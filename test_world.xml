                    You find yourself in the corner of a dark, dank cell. You 
                    can't see very well and the room is quiet.

                <cell>
                    You are in anther corner of the cell. You see a bleached
                    skeleton against the wall, covered in ripped rags. You
                    smell sulfer in the air.

                <cell>
                    The floor in this corner of the cell is slimey. You slip
                    while trying to examine the floor. Luckily, you don't seem
                    to get hurt. You smell sulfer in the air.

                <cell>
                    The smell of sulfer is overpowering now! You bumble your
                    way into this corner of the cell to find a large, black 
                    dragon!
