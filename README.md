TAGml - Text Adventure Game Markup Language
=====

TAGml is first a text-based adventure game engine and second a markup 
language for describing these games. TAGml seeks to remove the technical
elements from creating a text-based adventure game and make it as simple
to make an adventure game as it is to make a website. 

This project is currently in the planning phase. Please come back later
to see the code in progress.
